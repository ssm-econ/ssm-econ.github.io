I am a Economics PhD student in my third year at UT Austin. I am interested in expectations formation in markets, monetary policy and heterogenous agent models. I also enjoy working on problems in time-series analysis and bayesian econometrics. These days, I also spend my time trying to apply insights from Reinforcement Learning literature to macroeconomic policy. 


My background
======
I received my B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering from IIT Bombay in 2017. I then went on to work at CAFRAL (Policy-research wing of the Reserve Bank of India) for some time before joining the M.Phil program in Economics at UNSW, Sydney where I worked on monetary policy. I joined UT Austin in August 2020 and that is where I am currently.
