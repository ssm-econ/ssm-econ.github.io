I am a 4th year PhD student in Economics at the University of Texas at Austin. I am interested in monetary economics. I am interested in statistical learning in time-series analysis and bayesian econometrics. My research focuses on how Central Banks learn about the dynamics of the economy while trying to implement optimal policy conditional on its beliefs.
