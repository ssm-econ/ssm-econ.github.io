I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the University of Texas at Austin. My research focuses on the role of learning in macroeconomic dynamics. I am interested in how economic agents acquire information from their environment and inform their decisions. I will be on the 2025-26 job market.

My [job market paper](/files/Learning_and_Anchoring.pdf) investigates how private agents' structural learning along with the systematic conduct of monetary policy has led to the anchoring of long-run inflation expectations in the U.S. The estimated model explains why the recent post-pandemic inflation surge differed markedly from the protracted inflationary spiral of the 1970s and 80s. The key finding of the paper is that when agents are learning about policymakers' objectives from policy behavior, a large perceived weight on real-side stabilization makes agents' long-run inflation expectations *more* stable.
