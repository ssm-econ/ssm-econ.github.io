I am a 6th year PhD student in Economics at the University of Texas at Austin. I work primarily in monetary policy. My research focuses on the role of learning in macroeconomic dynamics. I am interested in statistical learning, structural time-series analysis and modeling expectations. I will be on the 2025-26 Job Market.
