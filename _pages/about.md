I am a 6th year PhD student in Economics at the University of Texas at Austin. My research focuses on the role of learning in macroeconomic dynamics.  I am interested in statistical learning, structural time-series analysis and modeling of expectations in macroeconomics. I will be on the 2025-26 Job Market.

My [job market paper](/files/Learning_and_Anchoring.pdf) investigates how private agents' learning along with the systematic conduct of monetary policy has led to the anchoring of long-run inflation expectations in the U.S. The model explains why the recent post-pandemic inflation surge differed markedly from the the protracted inflationary crisis of the 1970s and 80s, and what forces shaped agents' beliefs during these two episodes.
