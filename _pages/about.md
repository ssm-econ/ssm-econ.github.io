I am a Economics PhD student in my 4th year at UT Austin. I am interested in expectations formation in monetary policy and learning. I enjoy working on problems in time-series analysis and bayesian econometrics. I am currently working on models of central bank learning where central banks are not endowed with full information and must instead learn online as they observe data and implement policy. 


My background
======
I received my B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering from IIT Bombay in 2017. I then went on to work at CAFRAL (Policy-research wing of the Reserve Bank of India) for some time before joining the M.Phil program in Economics at UNSW, Sydney where I worked on monetary policy. I joined UT Austin in August 2020 and that is where I am currently.
