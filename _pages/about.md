I am a 6th year PhD student in Economics at the University of Texas at Austin. My research focuses on the role of learning in macroeconomic dynamics.  I am interested in how economic agents acquire information from their environment and inform their decisions. I will be on the 2025-26 Job Market.

My [job market paper](/files/Learning_and_Anchoring.pdf) investigates how private agents' structural learning along with the systematic conduct of monetary policy has led to the anchoring of long-run inflation expectations in the U.S. The estimated model explains why the recent post-pandemic inflation surge differed markedly from the the protracted inflationary spiral of the 1970s and 80s. Key finding: when agents are learning about policymakers' objectives from policy behavior, a larger perceived weight on real-side stabilization makes agents' long-run inflation expectations *more* stable.
