I am a 6th year PhD student in Economics at the University of Texas at Austin. I work primarily in monetary policy. My research focuses on the role of learning in macroeconomic dynamics. My job market paper investigates how private-sector agents' learning along with the systematic conduct of monetary policy has led to the anchoring of long-run inflation expectations in the U.S. The model also explains why the recent post-pandemic inflation surge resulted in markedly different economic outcomes (the oft cited "soft-landing" as compared to the protracted period of elevated inflation during the 1970s and 80s. I am interested in statistical learning, structural time-series analysis and modeling of expectations in macroeconomics. I will be on the 2025-26 Job Market.
