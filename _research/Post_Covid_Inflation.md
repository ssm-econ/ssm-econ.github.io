Using a model of constant-gain learning for Fed, I propose a model in which the Fed learns about the persistence of post-COVID inflation. I find that initially the perceived persistence is low but rises as inflation remains elevated. I also find that under full-information, the Fed would have raised rates about 50 basis points higher and about 3 months sooner than under learning.
