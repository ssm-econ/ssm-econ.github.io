excerpt: This paper explains U.S. post-war inflation and unemployment dynamics through a model of structural learning by private agents. Agents reason about observed macroeconomic realizations of the aggregate inflation rate, unemployment rate and the nominal interest rate based on New-Keynesian primitives, internalizing how aggregate outcomes are determined in equilibrium from individual optimizing behavior.

**(Job Market Paper)** This paper explains U.S. post-war inflation and unemployment dynamics through a model of structural learning by private agents. Agents reason about observed macroeconomic realizations of the aggregate inflation rate, unemployment rate and the nominal interest rate based on New-Keynesian primitives, internalizing how aggregate outcomes are determined in equilibrium from individual optimizing behavior. Agents assume that policy is set optimally under discretion but suspect that the policymakers' stabilization preferences are evolving with time, which the agents learn about from observed policy actions. Crucially, this framework generates an endogenous channel through which systematic monetary policy anchors expectations. The model demonstrates how Federal Reserve policy over the past forty years has stabilized long-run inflation expectations while rendering short-run expectations more susceptible to shocks by steadily putting more emphasis on real-side stabilization. The learning mechanism offers a new explanation for the recent inflation surge, and why it differed markedly from the crises of the 1970s and 1980s.
