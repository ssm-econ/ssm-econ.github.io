I identify FOMC minutes shocks using changes in treasury yields around FOMC minutes releases. I use methods motivated by Swanson (2021) to identify the current Fed Funds rate, Forward Guidance and LSAP components of the monetary policy shocks for both monetary policy announcements as well as minutes releases. I find a negative correlation between response of medium-term treasury yields to FOMC announcements and those to the corresponding release of minutes. Using the factor-decomposition in Swanson (2021), I interpret these as bond market overreaction to forward guidance information contained in announcements, with a revision followed by the release of FOMC minutes. I explain this observation using a model of diagnostic expectations.
