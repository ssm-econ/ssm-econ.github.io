I identify FOMC minutes shocks using changes intreasury yields around FOMC minutes releases. I use methods motivatedby Swanson (2019) to identify the current Fed Funds rate,Forward Guidance and LSAP components of the monetary policyshocks for both monetary policy announcements as well as minutesreleases. I estimate impulse responses to these shocks and find thatthey have similar effects on output. I also find that not accountingfor these minutes effects can lead to overestimating the sensitivityof macroeconomic aggregates to short-term rates and underestimatingthat of forward guidance. I also find some evidenceof financial market overreaction to forward guidance informationcontained in announcements and try to explain this observationusing a model of diagnostic expectations.
